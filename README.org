** Acknowledgements
Thanks to @daviwil for his excellent guix guides which remove a lot of the
bootstrapping pains for new guix users. This channel was bootstrapped off of
his examples and his nonguix bootstrapping guides are a lifesaver for real
world guix use: https://github.com/daviwil/channel-x
